# react-algo-practice

Collection of hand-written algorithm and data-structure practice challenges. These problems and implementations are written from scratch to revisit and reinforce old-school CS concepts (LRU cache, linked lists, trees, etc.).

Project layout
- algos/ — implementations and tests for each challenge (e.g. lru-cache.js, lru-cache.test.js)

Quick start
1. Install dev deps:
   npm install

2. Run tests (Vitest):
   npm test

3. Run linter fix:
   npm run lint

Notes
- Tests use Vitest and files are ESM modules.
- ESLint is configured to auto-fix on save in VS Code (see .vscode/settings.json).

License
- Personal practice repo.
